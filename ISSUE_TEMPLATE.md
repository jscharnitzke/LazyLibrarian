To help with identifying and fixing issues, please include as much information as possible, including:
### LazyLibrarian version number (at the bottom of config page)
### Operating system used (windows, mac, linux, NAS type)
### Interface in use (default, bookstrap)
### Source of your LazyLibrarian installation (git, zip file, 3rd party package)
### Relevant debug log with api keys and any passwords redacted

Please note - usually a single line of log is not sufficient. The lines just before the error occurs can give useful context and greatly assist with debugging.
